Learn to authenticate users with the database and sessions.

## Storing users in the database

Usually, a user account will be stored in a database. User accounts can also be considered
a resource: we can create a new user account (signing up), read its information (account
page), update it, etc.

Something you'll need to have in mind when storing user account information, especially
when it contains sensitive data (like a password), is encryption. A password should never
be stored in plain text in a database, as even databases can be subjected to security
breaches and attacks.

You can use the [`bcrypt`
gem](https://github.com/bcrypt-ruby/bcrypt-ruby#how-to-use-bcrypt-ruby-in-general) in Ruby
to achieve this. Make sure you store the encrypted password when inserting the user
account in the database, and check against the correct encrypted value when authenticating
the user.

```ruby
# file: lib/user_repository.rb

class UserRepository
  def create(new_user)
    # Encrypt the password to save it into the new database record.
    encrypted_password = BCrypt::Password.create(new_user.password)

    sql = '
      INSERT INTO users (email, password)
        VALUES($1, $2);
    '
    sql_params = [
      new_user.email,
      encrypted_password
    ]
  end

  def sign_in(email, submitted_password)
    user = find_by_email(email)

    return nil if user.nil?

    # Compare the submitted password with the encrypted one saved in the database
    if submitted_password == BCrypt::Password.new(user.password)
      # login success
    else
      # wrong password
    end
  end

  def find_by_email(email)
    # ...
  end
end
```

## On Sessions

By design, a web server cannot remember information about a specific client — it only
receives requests, and sends back a response. 

In order to keep track of data about a specific client, we can use a feature of Sinatra
called the session. By storing information in the session, we can make it available in any
subsequent requests from the same client.

Authentication is a very good example on how sessions can be useful — here is a typical
HTTP flow of a user signing in:

1. The user (through a web browser) signs in on a website using their credentials.
2. The web browser sends the HTTP request with the credentials to the server.
3. The server checks the credentials, usually by looking in a database.
4. If credentials are valid, the server **stores information about the signed-in user in
   the session** and sends back the response.
5. During any other request sent by the same client (so, by the same user), **the session
   will contain the user information stored previously**. For any other client, the
   session will not contain this information.

So the session is a way to "remember" information about a specific user, even though the
client they are using is sending many different requests to the server.

## Using sessions in Sinatra

```ruby
class Application < Sinatra::Base 
  # Sessions are disabled by default, so this line is needed.
  enable :sessions

  configure :development do
    register Sinatra::Reloader
  end

  # This route simply returns the login page
  get '/login' do
    return erb(:login)
  end

  # This route receives login information (email and password)
  # as body parameters, and find the user in the database
  # using the email. If the password matches, it returns
  # a success page.
  post '/login' do
    email = params[:email]
    password = params[:password]

    user = UserRepository.find_by_email(email)

    # This is a simplified way of 
    # checking the password. In a real 
    # project, you should encrypt the password
    # stored in the database.
    if user.password == password
      # Set the user ID in session
      session[:user_id] = user.id

      return erb(:login_success)
    else
      return erb(:login_error)
    end
  end

  # This route is an example
  # of a "authenticated-only" route.
  # It can be accessed only if a user is
  # signed-in (if we have user information in session).
  get '/account_page' do
    if session[:user_id] == nil
      # No user id in the session
      # so the user is not logged in.
      return redirect('/login')
    else
      # The user is logged in, display 
      # their account page.
      return erb(:account)
    end
  end
end
```

## Exercise (without a database)

In a new web project:

Create a new login form by test-driving two routes:
  * The first route `GET /login` simply returns the login form page.
  * The second route `POST /login` receives credentials (email and password), should then verify the password is equal to `s3cretp4ss`, and if it is, store a new variable in session to indicate the user is logged in.

You can also create an index page at `GET /` which returns a page indicating whether the user is logged in or not.

## Exercise (with a database)

Work through the same exercise as above, but this time, use the database to store user accounts. You should also use a Repository class to find and authenticate the user against the password submitted via the login form.
