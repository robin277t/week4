Learn to use the browser's developer console to get visibility into HTTP requests and responses.

## Intro

The web browser acts as a client — it sends requests to servers and get responses.

When you enter a URL in the browser, it sends an HTTP request to the server. When the response is received, if it contains HTML, the HTML is transformed into a user-friendly webpage.

Since the browser is a client, just like Postman, we can use it to inspect the sent request, and the received response.

Use the shortcut `Option+Command+J` on Mac, or go in the `View` menu, and select `Developer` and `Developer Tools`.
